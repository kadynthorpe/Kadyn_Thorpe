Current State

Placeholder information has been replaced with meaningful data.
Successfully connected to a backend Express API and PostgreSQL database.
Added many stylistic CSS touches all without using any libraries:
Rounded, reversable, modular card components
Animated overlays that link to each project's deployment
Buffering Animation that plays while waiting for the API call
Color scheme is on brand and consistent
Makes API call once on load, then as the user navigates through front-end routes, the data is just passed down through props to increase efficiency.
Whenever a change needs to be made to the content of my portfolio, it can be handled on the backend without redepoloying or even touching the frontend.


Todo:

Create a more modern, multi-column design to display portfolio information better for desktop users.
Improve overall responsiveness.
Add more of my work to the Backend Database.
Potentially make the contact and about me information also pull from a database.
Add a "Skills" section to the portfolio.
Take criticism and iterate further!
